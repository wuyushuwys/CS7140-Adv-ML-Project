# CS7140-Adv-ML-Project: Multimodal Emotion Recognization and Analysis
In this project, we use the multimodal method to recognize and analyze human emotions 
in combination with physical and physiological signals. We want to get a comparatively 
correct results given the different types of signals and list the primary components that 
lead to this result in these different types of signals. 
## Dataset
In this project, We use AMIGOS dataset, and there needs a license for download this dataset, so we cannot upload the dataset to Github, but you can download it from this link: 'http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/amigos/download.html'   
This dataset includes some physical(facial expression) and psychological(EEG, EOG and GSR) signals and we use them to train and test our model.
